By: `Team W11-4`      Since: `Jun 2019`      Licence: `MIT`

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `cs2103-ay1819s2-w11-4/main` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `cs2103-ay1819s2-w11-4/main`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/Alice`.

.Component interactions for `deleteBook 1` command
image::SDforDeleteBook.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `BookListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `BookShelfParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a book).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteBook 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteBook 1` Command
image::DeleteBookSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Book Shelf data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Book>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Book Shelf`, which `Book` can reference. This would allow `Book Shelf` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Book` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Book Shelf data in json format and read it back.
* users are not supposed to touch the data file (file inside the `data` folder) directly. If the user insists on doing so, the data might be corrupted.
* users are not supposed to add data files into the app manually. If you accidentally do so and find the data corrupted, you should reinstall the app and all previous data will get lost.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedBookShelf`.
It extends `BookShelf` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `BookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedBookShelf#commit()` -- Saves the current book shelf state in its history.
* `VersionedBookShelf#undo()` -- Restores the previous book shelf state from its history.
* `VersionedBookShelf#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone book shelf state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitBookShelf()`, `Model#undoBookShelf()` and `Model#redoBookShelf()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial book shelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single book shelf state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `deleteBook 1` command to delete the first book in the book shelf. The `deleteBook` command calls `Model#commitBookShelf()`, causing the modified state of the book list after the `deleteBook 1` command executes to be saved in the `BookShelfStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted book list state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `addBook n/David ...` to add a new book. The `addBook` command also calls `Model#commitBookShelf()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `BookShelfStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitBookShelf()`, so the book shelf state will not be saved into the `BookShelfStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the book was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoBookShelf()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous book shelf state, and restores the book shelf to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial book shelf state, then there are no previous book shelf states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canundoBookShelf()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoBookShelf()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the book shelf to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `BookShelfStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest book shelf state, then there are no undone book shelf states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canredoBookShelf()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `listBook`. Commands that do not modify the book shelf, such as `listBook`, will usually not call `Model#commitBookShelf()`, `Model#undoBookShelf()` or `Model#redoBookShelf()`. Thus, the `BookShelfStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitBookShelf()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `BookShelfStateList`, all book shelf states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `addBook n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire book list.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `deleteBook`, just save the book being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of book list states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedBookShelf`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

=== AddBook feature
==== Current Implementation

The addBook mechanism is facilitated by `BookShelf`.
It contains `UniqueBookList` in which all the book data are stored and duplicates are not allowed. Books with same book name are considered as duplicates.
Additionally, it uses the following operations from `BookShelf`:

* `model#hasBook()` -- Check if the book already exists in the book shelf.
* `model#addBook()` -- To add the new book into book shelf.
* `model#commitBookShelf()` -- Saves the current book shelf state for undo/redo..

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addBook mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial book shelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single book shelf state.

Step 2. The user executes `addBook n/Alice a/HR m/5 tag/fantasy` command to add the book called Alice, written by HR, with rating of 5 and tag of fantasy in the book list. The `addBook` command calls `Model#hasBook()`, checking if the book already exists in the book shelf.

[NOTE]
If the book already exists, CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_BOOK) will be thrown. It will not call `Model#commitBookShelf()`, so the book shelf state will not be saved into the `BookShelfStateList`.

Step 4. The book shelf now adds the book to the book list after making sure there is no duplicates, and calls Model#commitBookShelf(), causing the modified state of the book list after the `addBook` command executes to be saved in the BookShelfStateList

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How duplicate of book is defined

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Books with same book name are considered as duplicates.
** Pros: Easy to support other command such as addReview which search for the book based on its name.
** Cons: User may encounter trouble if they read two books with same name but written by different authors.
* **Alternative 2:** Books with multiple identical fields (eg. book name and author, book name and rating, etc) are considered same book.
** Pros: Able to store books with same same but different in other fields.
** Cons: Causing trouble to executing other commands like addReview as more parameters must be provided to search for a certain book.
//end::addBook[]

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the addBook command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire book as one object contains different components such as author, rating, etc.
** Pros: Easy to implement delete and other features that change an entire book.
** Cons: May be more difficult to implement the summary feature which needs to obtain statistics of all separate components, eg. find the most popular author.
* **Alternative 2:** Components stored as individual objects.
** Pros: Easier to obtain statistics regarding each component.
** Cons: It is hard to manage book object as we need to find a way to connect all components together.

=== EditBook feature
==== Current Implementation

The editBook mechanism is facilitated by `BookShelf`.
It contains `UniqueBookList` in which all the book data are stored and duplicates are not allowed. Books with same book name are considered as duplicates.
Additionally, it uses the following operations from `BookShelf`:

* `model#hasBook()` -- Check if the book already exists in the book shelf.
* `model#setBook()` -- To set a book with field values provided.
* `model#commitBookShelf()` -- Saves the current book shelf state for undo/redo..

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addBook mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial book shelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single book shelf state.

Step 2. The user executes `editBook 1 n/Alice a/HR m/5 tag/fantasy` command to edit the first book present in the book list to be a book called Alice, written by HR, with rating of 5 and tag of fantasy in the book list. The `addBook` command calls `Model#hasBook()`, checking if the book already exists in the book shelf.

[NOTE]
If the new book name already exists, CommandException(MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_BOOK) will be thrown. It will not call `Model#commitBookShelf()`, so the book shelf state will not be saved into the `BookShelfStateList`.

Step 4. The book shelf now set the fields of the first book to the new ones provided, and calls Model#commitBookShelf(), causing the modified state of the book list after the `addBook` command executes to be saved in the BookShelfStateList

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How editBook is executed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use index to figure out the book user wishes to edit.
** Pros: Easy to select the book user wish to edit with the support of our UI.
** Cons: A listBook command might be needed before executing editBook if the current filtered book list is empty
* **Alternative 2:** Use exact book name to figure out the book user wishes to edit.
** Pros: No need to first filter out a non-empty book list.
** Cons: Causing trouble for user to type in the full name of the book.

// tag::listBook[]
=== ListBook Feature

==== Current Implementation

Given below is an example usage and how listBook feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial book shelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single book shelf state.

Step 2. The user executes `listBook n/Life`.

Step 3. The `ListBookCommandParser` parses this command, and returns an `ListBookCommand`. Exception will be thrown if the command is invalid.

Step 4. The `ListBookCommand` executes. The command checks all the book in the `BookShelf`, filters out books whose name contain `Life` based on `BookNameContainsKeywordPredicate`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to select books.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only books match all criteria provided will be selected.
** Pros: Easy to test and manage.
** Cons: Such searching technique may fail to provide the user with enough inforamtion.
* **Alternative 2:** Select books that match at least one criteria.
** Pros: More likely to find the book that the user is looking for.
** Cons: Hard to test and manage.

// end::listBook[]


// tag::addReview[]
=== Review Features

==== AddReview Feature

===== Current Implementation

Given below is an example usage and how addReview feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBookShelf` will be initialized with the initial book shelf state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single book shelf state.

Step 2. The user executes `addReview n/Alice in Wonderland rt/Carroll has depicted a unique world I hadn't seen before r/Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll is a story about Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and lands into a fantasy world that is full of weird, wonderful people and animals.`

Step 3. The `AddReviewCommandParser` parses this command, and creates a `Review` object based on the parameters in user input.

Step 4. The `AddReviewCommandParser`returns an `AddReviewCommand`. Exception will be thrown if the command is invalid.

Step 5. The `AddReviewCommand` executes. The command checks if the book to which the review is added exists in the `BookShelf`, based on `BookNameContainsExactKeywordPredicate`. If the book does not exist, an exception is thrown.

Step 6. If the book exists, the review is added to the review list of the Book Shelf.

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Data structure to store Reviews

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a List to store Reviews
** Pros: There will be an order for the reviews added based on time created. More clear to users.
** Cons: May have unforeseen bugs or implications.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a Set to store all Reviews, just like tags.
** Pros: Easy to code and manage because it is the same implementation as tags.
** Cons: Set does not allow duplicate reviews. Need to check for duplicate reviews added.

====== Aspect: Where to store Reviews

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have another independent list for reviews in the book shelf.
** Pros: Much easier to implement.
** Cons: Reviews and Books now have exactly the same structure, which violates the DRY principle.
* **Alternative 2:** Use a Set within a Book, just like tags.
** Pros: The model makes more sense because Reviews belong to Books.
** Cons: Makes it more difficult to link with the UI component.

====== Aspect: Constraints on Review Parameters

* ReviewTitle has the same constraints as BookName, less than 50 characters.
* ReviewMessage should be less than or equal to 400 characters. This is because the
BookBrowserPanel used to display the ReviewMessage currently cannot hold more than 400 characters.
Longer text also makes it more difficult to edit in the small CommandBox. Future releases would consider
adding enhanced review input panel to make the review feature more user friendly.

====== Aspect: Auto-creation of Date for the Review

* Currently, the constructor of Review automatically assigns a dateCreated to it.
This feature is provided for the convenience of the user. An overloaded constructor
is available where the date can be passed in as a parameter, to be used in testing.

==== ListReview Feature

===== Current Implementation

Given below is an example usage and program behaviour:

Step 1. The user executes `listReview 1`

Step 2. The ListReviewCommandParser parses this command, and returns a new ListReviewCommand with the specified index.

Step 3. The ListReviewCommand executes. The book with the specified index is selected.

Step 4. Reviews of the selected book will be displayed in the rightmost panel.

Alternatively, the user can click the book to select it.

====== Aspect:

==== ListAllReviews Feature
===== Current Implementation

The ListAllReviews Feature uses the same implementation as the ListBook feature:

Step 1. The user executes `listAllReviews`

Step 2. A new ListAllReviewsCommand is returned by the BookShelfParser

Step 3. The ListAllReviewsCommand executes. Review list panel is updated to show all reviews.

===== Design Considerations

====== Aspect: Whether to combine ListAllReviews command with ListReview command

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** not to combine.
** Pros: Command is more logical and user friendly because it is actually not intuitive to have two functions combined in one ListReview command.
** Cons: Inconsistency with the ListBook command may cause confusion.
* **Alternative 2:** Combine.
** Pros: Consistency.
** Cons: Command is not intuitive, and takes extra time to implement review predicates.

==== SelectReview Feature
===== Current Implementation

Selection of review is implemented the same way as selection of book.

In addition, review message of selected review will be displayed in the book browser panel.

Step 1. The user executes `selectReview 1`

Step 2. The SelectReviewCommandParser parses this command, and returns a new SelectReviewCommand with index 1.

Step 3. The SelectReviewCommand executes. The review with the specified index is selected.

Step 4. The BookBrowserPanel listens to the change in selected review, and displays its review message.


==== DeleteReview Feature
===== Current Implementation

Review is deleted based on index.

Step 1. The user executes `deleteReview 1`

Step 2. The DeleteReviewCommandParser parses this command, and returns a new DeleteReviewCommand with index 1.

Step 3. The DeleteReviewCommand executes. The review with the specified index is deleted.

==== Other Design Considerations

===== Whether to Implement EditReview

It seems natural to implement EditReview as one component of the CRUD features. However,
editing an existing review requires re-typing everything and seems painstaking to the user. It makes much more sense to just delete
the original review and add a new one. Hence. EditReview is currently not implemented.




// end::addReview[]

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Book Shelf depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
